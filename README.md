# JSViz-Framework-with-CanvasJS-A-JavaScript-based-visualization-in-Tibco-Spotfire

The JavaScript Visualization Framework, or JSViz, is a Custom Extension for TIBCO Spotfire that allows users to create their own visualizations using JavaScript libraries, such as d3, but still allow them to seamlessly integrate with the Spotfire platform.

The code herewith shows how CanvasJS (third-party) framework creates Box-Plots where multiple lines are used to connect the boxes. This JavaScript code can integrate with Spotfire via JSViz framework. renderCore() method within the JSViz framework does majority of the integration between spotfire data and JavaScript visual. Filtering and marking functionalities integrate perfectly as well.
